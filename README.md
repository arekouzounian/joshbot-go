# Joshbot 2.0
Re-write of joshbot in Go. I clearly have too much time.

- two josh's in a row by the same use is called a "double josh" and is disallowed (deleted)
- "josh" messages and "non josh" messages alike are sent to an API, which is used to populate a react frontend with statistics
- a josh of the week is chosen every Monday at 12:00am PST
- josh messages earn users josh coins 
- a josh leaderboard and non josh wall of shame are displayed on the website among other statistics
