# Joshbot 2.0
Re-write of joshbot in Go. I clearly have too much time. 


## Features
- deletes any message that isn't the word "josh" 
- renames every user to "josh" 


## Proposed Features
- time since last josh 
- average josh time 
- graph of joshes vs non joshes (josh score ?)
- josh of the week (uniform distribution) <- POST (bot driven)
